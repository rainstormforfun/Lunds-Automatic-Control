We observe, and mathematically describe, various phenomenons in our enviroment.</p> <p>In automatic control, we use these knowledge to control these phenomenons.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>Auto pilots provide the vessels with constant bearings, despite winds and currents</li> <li>To keep a constant temperature in buildings, despite variations in the outdoor temperature and the number of persons in the building</li> <li>In the process industry, to maintain desired temperature, flows, pressures......</li> <li>Modern cars: cruise control, anti-lock brake system, power steering, emission reduction and air conditioning</li> <li>Cameras: auto focus, auto exposure</li> <li>The human body is a control system.</li> </ul>"}]}

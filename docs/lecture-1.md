# Introduction——The PID Controller

> one of the simpler and most commonly used controller——the PID controller

## What is Automatic Control

We have learned how nature works from physics and mechanics. We observe, and mathematically describe, various phenomenons in our enviroment.

In automatic control, we use these knowledge to control these phenomenons.

Examples:

- Auto pilots provide the vessels with constant bearings, despite winds and currents
- To keep a constant temperature in buildings, despite variations in the outdoor temperature and the number of persons in the building
- In the process industry, to maintain desired temperature, flows, pressures......
- Modern cars: **cruise control, anti-lock brake system, power steering, emission reduction and air conditioning**
- Cameras: auto focus, auto exposure
- The human body is a control system.
